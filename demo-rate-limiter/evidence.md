# Evidence Report — Sliding-Window Rate Limiter (Tier 3)

## Orientation
- **Verdict:** **PASSED WITH LIMITS.** Every gauntlet layer is green at source
  state `4734451`, but independent verification is `not performed` against that
  state. This report is finalized as a **declared downgrade**, not on a passing
  verdict.
- **Delivered:** an in-process `RateLimiter(limit, window_seconds, clock)` with
  `allow(key) -> bool` — sliding window per key, thread-safe, with a throttled
  sweep that bounds the key map temporally.
- **Proven:** 31/31 mapped scenarios pass; 50 tests, 100% changed-line coverage
  (49/49 statements, 20/20 branches, gated), 22/22 mutants killed. The mutation
  score is carried **entirely by the scenario suite** — the properties alone
  kill 3/22.
- **Not proven:** two layers this skill now requires at Tier 3 have **no row in
  the table below and did not run** — adversarial review by an independent agent,
  and the egress/output-surface check; both postdate this demo, and the six
  verification rounds below are not a substitute for either. Also: the shipped
  state was never independently verified; shell lint never ran on the four scripts
  that implement half the gates; tool-based mutation was substituted; two 2026-07
  spec revisions remain unapproved; evidence is generated on Python 3.14 while CI
  gates on 3.12.
- **Read first:** *Independent verification* — it is where the downgrade lives.

The writeup below, in brief:

- **Spec → test mapping:** 31 rows, all `pass`, no `unverified` or `n-a`. Both
  Must NOT constraints are mapped — one to a test, one to the must-not scan.
- **Gauntlet:** 15 layers. Three exist to prove the harness can fail — a checker
  self-test (3/3), a source-state self-test (9/9), and a mutation negative
  control (C1 killed, C2 survived).
  One layer is `n-a` (license check: zero runtime dependencies); the rest pass.
- **Verification:** six rounds, each a fresh context at a different commit. Round
  6 returned **`failed`** with one behavioural gap. Rounds 1–3 found what no
  green layer could reach: a one-shot-key memory leak usable as a remote DoS
  against the component meant to prevent one, `limit=NaN` producing a limiter
  that always allows, 2× over-allow under threads, and a mutation runner
  reporting kills for mutants it never executed. Four fixes made after round 6
  are disclosed as unverified.
- **Known limits:** the memory bound is temporal, not cardinal — unbounded
  distinct keys *within* one window is accepted residual risk; forward clock
  skew, NaN readings and reentrant clocks are caller obligations, undefended in
  code; no `Retry-After` accessor.
- **Honest notes:** the A/B experiment this started as **failed** — the "clean"
  control arm independently invented the planted defect, so no false-positive
  rate could be measured. All six verifier rounds ran on the builder's model, so
  the correlation broken is context, not model. **Three defects were introduced
  by fixes**, and verification did not converge just because round 4 came back
  clean.

- Spec approval: **obtained** for REVISION 4 (2026-08-09), REVISION 5 and
  REVISION 6 (2026-08-18) — the human approved each contract change before
  implementation. Earlier revisions (2026-07-25, 2026-07-27) were autonomous
  and are still unapproved; treat them as the weaker part of the spec.
- Independent verification: **not performed against the final source state
  `4734451`.** Six earlier rounds were performed; the last verified state
  `d0b506c` returned `failed`, and the fixes made since — one of them
  behavioural — are disclosed below as unverified. This report is finalized as
  a **declared downgrade**, not on the strength of a passing verdict. A
  verdict attaches to the state a verifier actually saw, and no verifier has
  seen this one.
- Source state: source commit `4734451`; sha256 tree hash
  `dbccc212daa35442` — reproduce both with `./tools/source_state.sh` from any
  directory. When a binding is produced the tree hash is the required content
  identity; the source commit is provenance and is supplied only where
  complete history is available, so a shallow checkout reports
  `(unavailable: shallow history)` and a no-Git archive reports `(no git)`,
  both alongside this same tree hash. No error path emits a binding at all.
  The script separately reports current HEAD; commits after `4734451` that
  touch only this report or other out-of-scope paths preserve the source
  commit and tree hash. The manifest includes `.github/workflows`, which
  decides whether the gauntlet runs in CI at all.
- Toolchain: pinned in `requirements-dev.txt` (local run: Python 3.14.3;
  CI runs the same gauntlet on 3.12 via `.github/workflows/gauntlet.yml`).
- Entry point: `./tools/gauntlet.sh` reruns every layer below.

All numbers are from one final fresh run of the entry point, executed
2026-08-18 at source commit `4734451` after the last code edit.

`spec.md` was deliberately pruned back to a contract before REVISION 5
(339 → 255 lines). Every clause, invariant, obligation and failure-model row
survived; what was removed is the per-revision forensics, which lives in the
honest notes below and in git. REVISION 5 adds the approved source-binding
contract and tests without changing rate-limiter behaviour.

## Gauntlet (final fresh run: `./tools/gauntlet.sh`)

| Layer | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Checker self-test | `sh tools/test_gauntlet_checks.sh` (first layer; asserts the must-not scan fails on a planted pattern, passes on a clean tree, and fails closed with a distinct rc 2 when the scan itself breaks) | 3/3 expectations ok |
| Source-state self-test | `pytest -q tests/test_source_state.py` (negative controls for the covered fail-closed scenarios; shallow/full-history, clean clone and no-Git archive comparisons) | 9/9 passed |
| Mutation harness negative control | `python tools/mutants.py --negative-control` (a killer and a strictly-equivalent mutant of identical size under one pinned mtime) | C1 KILLED, C2 SURVIVED — ok |
| Tests | `pytest -q --cov=ratelimiter` | 50 passed, 0 failed |
| Types | `mypy src tests examples tools` (strict) | 0 errors in 8 files |
| Lint + format + complexity | `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` (mccabe ≤ 8) | 0 warnings, 10 files formatted |
| Changed-line coverage | `pytest --cov … --cov-fail-under=100` | 49/49 statements, 20/20 branches (100%). **This layer is a gate**; before 2026-08-09 it printed a percentage and exited 0 no matter how far coverage fell |
| Mutation | `python tools/mutants.py` (manual, scripted; only pytest exit 1 counts as a kill; `__pycache__` cleared and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` set per mutant) | 22/22 killed |
| Property-based | hypothesis, 2 properties | 100 examples each, 0 falsified |
| Real execution | `python examples/demo.py` (real `time.monotonic`) | burst of 5 → `[True, True, True, False, False]`; other key unaffected; allowed again after window |
| Supply chain | `pip-audit -r requirements-dev.txt` | no known vulnerabilities; runtime dependencies: **none** (stdlib only; `threading` is stdlib) |
| Secret scan | must-not scan in `tools/gauntlet.sh` over src, tests, tools, examples, spec.md, pyproject.toml, requirements-dev.txt and `../.github` | clean, no matches |
| Source binding | `tools/source_state.sh` (last gauntlet layer) | source commit `4734451`; tree `dbccc212daa35442`; current HEAD is reported separately |
| License check | — | n-a: zero runtime dependencies, nothing redistributed beyond this repo's own MIT code |
| Suite health | pytest-randomly (order shuffled every run) | 50 passed in randomized order, 10/10 consecutive runs |

## Layer attribution

- Property suite alone: **3/22** mutants killed (M1, M3, M5). The properties
  are single-threaded and never construct an invalid limiter, so validation,
  key-identity, memory, sweep and concurrency mutants are all outside their
  reach by construction.
- Scenario suite alone: **22/22**. The headline mutation score is carried
  entirely by the scenario tests.

## Layers not run as specified

- **SUBSTITUTED — tool-based mutation (mutmut):** unverified compatibility with
  Python 3.14; the scripted manual procedure ran instead (`tools/mutants.py`,
  22 mutants). What it cannot detect: the mutant list is hand-written, so
  unlike a tool generating mutants from the syntax tree it can only test
  weaknesses somebody thought of in advance.
- **UNAVAILABLE — shell lint (shellcheck)** for the four scripts that implement
  half the gates: no tool installed, and nothing ran in its place. Every Python
  file gets three static layers and the shell gets none. Known gap, raised by
  verification round 4.

## Independent verification

Six rounds, each a fresh agent context given only the task contract, the
approved SPEC, the repository at an exact source state, and the gauntlet entry
point — never the builder's reasoning, and never the draft of this report.
Each ran against a different commit; a round that raised a finding never
judged its own fix.

| Round | Commit | Behavioural defects | Description / mapping defects | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (two arms) | `9540d72` | 3 material, found by both arms independently | 2 | failed |
| 2 | `e677832` | 1 material (the mutation harness) | 5 | failed |
| 3 | `e210594` | 1 material (lock scope) | 6 | failed |
| 4 | `49afb2b` | 1 (backward skew) | 3 | passed |
| 5 | `d65acbe` | 0 | 6 (1 rated material) | failed |
| 6 | `d0b506c` | 1 gap (sweep threshold magnitude) | 6 | failed |

What rounds 1–3 found, none of which the ten green layers could reach: a
one-shot-key memory leak usable as a remote DoS against the component meant
to *prevent* one; `limit=NaN`/`inf` producing a limiter that always allows;
2× over-allow under threads; and a mutation runner reporting kills for
mutants it never executed.

Rounds 4–6 found one behavioural gap and a steady stream of inaccuracies in
the prose — and **two of those were introduced by the round that fixed the
previous one**. That is the honest shape of the result: verification does not
converge just because one round comes back clean.

**Verification stopped after round 6, deliberately.** A rule of "fix every
finding, then start a new verifier" only terminates when a round returns the
empty set, and prose has no such fixpoint.

That decision has a price this report states rather than hides: round 6's
verdict was `failed`, one of its findings was behavioural, and the state that
ships was never verified. Under the protocol's own four states, that makes the
final state `not performed` — the earlier rounds are history, not a
certificate. The following were fixed after round 6 and are **not
independently verified**:

- the sweep threshold magnitude test and mutant M23;
- the vacuous-pass assertion added to the clock-ordering test;
- the six prose corrections listed in commit `66df5cd`;
- the prune of `spec.md` from 339 to 255 lines in commit `8b88bda`. No clause
  was changed, but it is a large edit to the document a verifier attacks
  hardest, and it was made after the last verified state;
- REVISION 5 and the reproducible, fail-closed source-state mechanism in
  commits `86bfcf4` and `d45cc2f`;
- REVISION 6 and the shallow-history provenance repair in commits `3e45e16`
  and `49e8762`, plus the historical CI wording correction in `4734451`.

## Honest notes

- **The first REVISION 6 evidence rebind was internally stale.** Commit
  `83004bf` updated the headline source state but left four REVISION 5 values in
  the gauntlet table: 6 rather than 9 source-state tests, 47 rather than 50
  total tests, the old `d45cc2f` / `76389992f4e342e2` binding, and a suite-health
  row for the old 47-test suite. Review caught the mismatch against the same
  successful CI log the report was meant to summarize. The table now comes
  from a fresh gauntlet at `4734451`; the 50-test randomized suite was also
  rerun separately 10/10 times rather than inheriting the old result. Its
  negative-control wording is narrowed from “every error path” to the five
  failure scenarios actually exercised.

- **The REVISION 5 binding shipped a provenance defect, and CI published it
  twice.** `source commit` was defined as the most recent commit that changed
  the source scope, but the command never checked whether the repository held
  enough history to answer. In a shallow repository `git log` attributes the
  scope to the grafted HEAD, so the command returned a real-looking commit
  that had not touched the source — at exit 0, with no warning. Because
  `actions/checkout@v4` defaults to `fetch-depth: 1`, the canonical CI was
  exactly the environment that ran it wrongly:

  | Run | Reported source commit | Truth |
  |---|---|---|
  | PR #12 check (temporary merge checkout) | `a4276a2` | `d45cc2f` |
  | post-merge `main` | `57ebbbb` | `d45cc2f` |

  The tree hash `76389992f4e342e2` was correct in both runs, so the content
  binding held throughout; only the provenance label was wrong. It failed in
  the direction that looks fine — plausible SHA, exit 0, gauntlet green — and
  no layer could catch it, because no negative control covered a truncated
  history. Found by re-deriving the binding in a `--depth 1` clone during
  review of REVISION 5, not by the gauntlet. REVISION 6 makes truncated
  history report `(unavailable: shallow history)`, adds the missing control,
  and sets `fetch-depth: 0` so CI exercises the real path instead of sitting
  permanently in the degraded one.

- **Three of the REVISION 5 negative controls were weaker than they read.**
  The wrapper exits 2 when Python cannot find the implementation, so
  `assert returncode != 0` proved nothing about which guard fired;
  `test_missing_manifest_input_fails_closed` asserted only that, and would
  have passed against a completely broken script. It also mis-described
  itself: under Git a deleted tracked input is reported as *dirty*, and the
  `source input is missing` guard it appeared to cover is unreachable in the
  Git path. It is renamed, every control now pins its reason and asserts
  `stdout == ""`, and two new controls exercise that guard in the no-Git
  manifest where it actually lives.

- **One REVISION 6 change is not covered by a negative control, deliberately
  disclosed.** The test fixture used to copy the implementation only
  `if implementation.exists()`, so a deleted implementation would have
  degraded the fixture silently. It is now copied unconditionally. Reinstating
  the guard does not turn any test red, because the implementation exists in
  every tree the suite can reach; the change buys diagnosability, not a
  provable property, and writing a control for a state the suite cannot enter
  would cost more than it proves. Recorded rather than counted as verified.

- **The previous source binding was invalid.** The reported tree
  `c80e8cccf0a1ed3a` included four Git-ignored `*.egg-info` files created by
  `pip install -e .`; a clean checkout at the cited commit instead produced
  `939188446f61289c`. Because those generated files can also vary with the
  setuptools version, neither hash was a trustworthy Git-source binding. The
  old `find | sort | xargs | shasum` pipeline could additionally print success
  after a missing input. REVISION 5 replaced it with a canonical tracked-file
  manifest, explicit dirty/untracked rejection, structured path+content
  hashing, a deterministic no-Git fallback, six negative controls, and a
  second clean-state check around hashing. The binding REVISION 5 produced was
  `d45cc2f` / `76389992f4e342e2`; it was gauntlet-tested but never independently
  verified, and REVISION 6 superseded it.

- **The A/B experiment that started this failed.** The design was to plant a
  defect in one copy and verify a clean copy as a false-positive control. The
  "clean" arm was not clean: it independently invented the exact mutation that
  had been planted in the other arm and reported it as a real finding, which
  it was. The planted defect only made an existing spec/test hole explicit,
  so the arms were not distinguishable and no false-positive rate could be
  measured. This is an exploratory adversarial case study, not a successful
  A/B benchmark, and nothing here supports a general claim about verifier
  accuracy. Two false positives did occur, both caused by the harness feeding
  a subdirectory instead of the repository and a tree polluted by an editable
  install — verifier noise was a function of input quality, on n=2.
- **All six verifier rounds ran on the same model as the builder.** Their
  convergence shows the findings are reproducible, not that they are
  independent of model bias. The correlation this breaks is context, not
  model.
- **The concurrency scenario's stress test is statistical.** Per-round
  detection against the real source mutant measured 3.7% on this machine
  (an earlier 5.9% in this report came from a Python replica rather than the
  mutant); at 400 rounds the miss probability is ~3e-7, and the rate is
  machine-dependent. It is deliberately **not** the catcher for that row —
  the deterministic fault-injection test is, and it kills M13 5/5. At the
  original 60 rounds the lock-removal mutant was observed surviving 1 run in
  50, which is why the row was restructured.
- **Two tests depend on real wall-clock time**, declared in spec.md: one
  asserts a blocked thread is still alive after 0.2s (spurious direction:
  failure) and one waits up to 0.3s for a racing caller (spurious direction:
  a false PASS, i.e. a surviving fail-open mutant — the worse direction).
  Measured margin ~470×.
- **Equivalent mutants, classified rather than killed**: a `while`→`if`
  under-prune proposed by verification as a defect proved equivalent under a
  monotone clock (0 divergences over 200k randomized sequences), as did
  several sweep-timing variants. Killing them would need tests asserting
  non-behaviour, which anti-gaming rule 4 forbids.
- **The historical 8/8 mutation figure, stated precisely.** The runner used
  before 2026-08-09 was vulnerable to `.pyc` reuse between same-size mutants
  written in the same second, and exactly one adjacent pair could collide
  (M4/M5, both 1675 bytes). Re-derived on the historical source under a sound
  procedure, all 8 are genuinely killed, M5 included. The published figure is
  therefore **correct in outcome even though the procedure that produced it
  was unsound**; whether that archived run took the collision path cannot be
  determined, and does not change the number.
- **A negative control that was itself vacuous.** The first version of the
  mutation harness's negative control waited for two writes to land in the
  same second rather than pinning the mtime, and passed with the defence
  removed. It was caught only because the control was tested for its ability
  to fail. Its second version used a control mutant that was not strictly
  equivalent. Both are recorded because "prove the checker can fail" is a
  rule this project states, and it took two attempts to satisfy it here.
- **Three defects were introduced by fixes** in this sequence: the lock added
  in REVISION 4 did not cover the clock read (found in round 3); the NaN
  paragraph corrected in 4d contained a fresh false claim (round 5); and the
  "just under 2W" bound written in 4e was wrong (round 6).
- **Layer attribution moved during the work.** Widening the property
  strategies to answer one finding *weakened* the property layer — the
  fail-open mutant M5 stopped being killed by the properties, because with
  258 possible keys and limits up to 20 hypothesis almost never drove a key
  to its limit. Re-tuned to 12 keys and limits 1–5, measured rather than
  guessed. Without the Tier 3 attribution requirement this regression would
  have been invisible: the full suite stayed green throughout.
- **Known gaps left open**: the memory bound is temporal, not cardinal —
  unbounded distinct keys *within* one window is accepted residual risk;
  forward clock skew, NaN clock readings and reentrant clocks are caller
  obligations, not defended in code; there is no `Retry-After` accessor; the
  shell scripts have no lint layer; and evidence is generated on Python 3.14
  while CI gates on 3.12.
- **Spec revisions 2026-07-25 and 2026-07-27 remain unapproved**, and the
  revision-3 failure model was a retrofit reconstructed after implementation
  rather than written before it.
- **Git history note**: the demo originally ran without git. The repo is now
  under git; source state above cites the commit.
