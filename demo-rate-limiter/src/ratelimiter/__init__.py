    window individually. A backward-jumping clock fails closed: past hits never
    expire early. A forward jump expires every hit at once — that is a caller
    obligation, not a defect (see the clock contract in spec.md).

    Safe to call from multiple threads. Memory is bounded by the distinct
    keys seen within TWO windows, not one: a key is dropped by the first sweep
    that runs more than a window after its last hit, and sweeps are throttled
    to at most one per window, so worst-case retention is just under 2W. The
    bound is temporal, not cardinal — see the accepted residual risk in
    spec.md.
