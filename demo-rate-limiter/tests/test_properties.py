# [REVISION 4] Keys were `st.sampled_from("abc")`, so the whole suite ever saw
# three distinct keys and an implementation hardcoded to them scored 100%
# coverage and 8/8 mutants. A small alphabet keeps collisions frequent (which
# is what makes P1 bite) while ranging far outside any hardcoded set.
# Widening this too far blunts the layer: with 258 possible keys and limits up
# to 20, hypothesis almost never drives one key to its limit, so the deny
# branch goes unexercised and the fail-open mutant M5 survives the property
# suite. 12 keys keeps collisions frequent while still ranging outside any
# hardcoded key set. Measured by the layer-attribution run, not guessed.

# P2 needs the target key to recur, so it keeps a small pool — but the pool is
# no longer three single characters. The widening above was applied to P1 only
# in the first pass, directly under the comment explaining it; P2 was left
# behind. What the widening fixed is the strip()-merge blindness (the pool held
# "c " but not "c", so no two members could merge). It did NOT change P2's
# attribution: measured, P2 alone still kills none of M1/M5/M12.
