# Matches usage forms, not the word: `time\.` alone missed `from time import
# sleep`. Deliberately not a bare word-boundary match on `time`, which fires
# on conftest's own "No real time in tests" docstring, on `timestamps`, on
# `timeout=` and on ordinary prose — the fix belongs in the pattern, never in
# an exclusion.
#
# Scope is narrower than the Must NOT's ambition: `Event.wait(timeout=)` and
# `Thread.join(timeout=)` are NOT matched. They are declared in spec.md as an
# exception rather than excluded here, because a pattern cannot decide intent.
